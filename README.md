# Risk-quant
Bank of China
This project was a quantitative risk internship I undertook at the headquarters of Bank of China. The task was to predict the default probability of municipal bonds. You can learn about my internship project by clicking on the "Intern Report in BOC" document. Initially, this document was a report in Chinese to the BOC leadership, and later I used AI to translate it. There might be some minor formatting incompatibilities, but I have read the English version and believe you can fully understand my efforts and contributions. The "投产" document will give you insight into the project code I worked on, which includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model selection, result analysis, automated preparation of pkl files, and quantitative production deployment. Thank you for your click. I am a job-seeking student from New York University, and my passion for Risk Management will not wane. I am confident that I will do even better in the future! I wish you all the best!
